Note: This is a prototype

#AIRacer
The project aims to use a genetic algorithm to create neural networks which can drive cars fast around any track provided by the user.
This project is to learn and explore my interest areas Machine Learning, 3D graphics and Physics, therefore I am not using any existing libraries or reusing existing code (other than libraries which do not fall under my interest areas eg. JSON parsing).

Track specification: The Drivable road has to be drawn in White. Any other color is considered an obstacle.

Current implementation:
* Physics: None other than F = ma
* Network: Crude implementation with only Sigmoid activation
* UI: Basic 2D
* Inputs: Currently stored in constant values in Classes

Planned:
* Physics: To implement kinematics and effects due to inertia, weight transfer, tyre grip, skid, suspension etc
* Network: High performance, highly configurable network (even Cuda implementation with JNI, if I go really overboard)
* UI: 3D with Global Illumination
* Inputs: To be provided by user via property files
